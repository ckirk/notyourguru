### Coaching

"Not Your Guru" is more than a brand; it's a philosophy rooted in the belief that true wellness comes from empowering individuals to cultivate a deeper connection with themselves. As a personal trainer and wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of services, including in-person training, online coaching, transformative retreats, and ready-made training programs. My approach is not about providing quick fixes or being someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping individuals with the tools they need to navigate their own journey towards physical and emotional well-being. With a lifetime of learning and personal experience in both realms, I aim to foster a supportive environment where clients can discover their inner strength, resilience, and self-awareness.
