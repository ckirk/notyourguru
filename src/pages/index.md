      description: "Not Your Guru Retreats offers education for life. Every individual
        is unique in their own journey, so the most powerful thing one can
        achieve is a deeper understanding and connection to self.  We are not
        your guru; and no one should be. This is why we offer a range of
        modalities and courses taught by experts across such practices as yoga,
        pilates, nutrition, meditation, and functional training, so you can
        discover what resonates best with your body and lifestyle. "

      text: Expand Your Capabilities
      description: Experience yourself at your best and be extraordinary. Expanding
        your capabilities is crucial for personal growth because it pushes you
        beyond your comfort zone. By taking on our challenges, you not only
        expand your skills and knowledge but also build resilience and
        confidence in your abilities. Not Your Guru Retreats fosters an
        environment where you can gauge your current strengths, identify areas
        for improvement, and set realistic goals - fitness or otherwise -
        tailored to your individual abilities.

      text: Connection to Self, Others, and Nature
      description: Remove yourself from the hustle and bustle of every day life, where
        many of us spend our days looking right through other people, and take
        time to connect to yourself, others, and nature. Connection and presence
        is essential for cultivating inner peace, fostering meaningful
        relationships, and experiencing the profound beauty of the natural
        world. Encountering other like-minded individuals in a serene retreat
        setting not only encourages camaraderie but also provides opportunities
        for shared growth, support, and inspiration.

  heading: About Jesse
  description: >-
    If you are reading this then that means something about this page has
    captured your interest, and for that I am grateful. My name is Jesse, and I
    started "Not Your Guru" as a philosophy rooted in the belief that true
    wellness comes from empowering individuals to cultivate a deeper connection
    within themselves. 


    As a personal trainer and wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of services, including in-person training, online coaching, transformative retreats, and ready-made training programs. My approach is not about providing quick fixes or being someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping individuals with the tools they need to navigate their own journey towards physical and emotional well-being. With a lifetime of learning and personal experience in both realms, my objective is to foster a supportive environment where clients can discover their inner strength, resilience, and self-awareness.
