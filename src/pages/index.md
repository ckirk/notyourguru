      text: Exposure To Different Modalities of Fitness and Wellness
      description: "Not Your Guru Retreats offers education for life. Every individual
        is unique in their own journey, so the most powerful thing one can
        achieve is a deeper understanding and connection to self.  We are not
        your guru; and no one should be. This is why we offer a range of
        modalities and courses taught by experts across such practices as yoga,
        pilates, nutrition, meditation, and functional training, so you can
        discover what resonates best with your body and lifestyle. "

      text: Expand Your Capabilities
      description: Experience yourself at your best and be extraordinary. Expanding
        your capabilities is crucial for personal growth because it pushes you
        beyond your comfort zone. By taking on our challenges, you not only
        expand your skills and knowledge but also build resilience and
        confidence in your abilities. Not Your Guru Retreats fosters an
        environment where you can gauge your current strengths and weaknesses,
        identify areas for improvement, and set realistic goals - fitness or
        otherwise - tailored to your individual abilities.

      text: Connection to Self, Others, and Nature
      description: Remove yourself from the hustle and bustle of every day life, where
        most people spend their days looking right through other people, and
        take time to connect to yourself, others, and nature. Connection and
        presence is essential for cultivating inner peace, fostering meaningful
        relationships, and experiencing the profound beauty of the natural
        world. Encountering other like-minded individuals in a serene retreat
        setting not only encourages camaraderie but also provides opportunities
        for shared growth, support, and inspiration.

  heading: About Jesse
  description: Jesse started "Not Your Guru" as more than a brand, but as a
    philosophy rooted in the belief that true wellness comes from empowering
    individuals to cultivate a deeper connection with themselves. As a personal
    trainer and wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of
    services, including in-person training, online coaching, transformative
    retreats, and ready-made training programs. My approach is not about
    providing quick fixes or being someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping
    individuals with the tools they need to navigate their own journey towards
    physical and emotional well-being. With a lifetime of learning and personal
    experience in both realms, I aim to foster a supportive environment where
    clients can discover their inner strength, resilience, and self-awareness.
