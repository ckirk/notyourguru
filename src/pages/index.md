heading: About Not Your Guru
subheading: Personal trainer and wellness coach practitioner
description: "\"Not Your Guru\" is more than a brand; it's a philosophy rooted
  in the belief that true wellness comes from empowering individuals to
  cultivate a deeper connection with themselves. As a personal trainer and
  wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of services, including
  in-person training, online coaching, transformative retreats, and ready-made
  training programs. My approach is not about providing quick fixes or being
  someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping individuals with the tools they
  need to navigate their own journey towards physical and emotional well-being.
  With a lifetime of learning and personal experience in both realms, I aim to
  foster a supportive environment where clients can discover their inner
  strength, resilience, and self-awareness."
