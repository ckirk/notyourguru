    We are not your guru, because nobody should be. But we can help you
    **discover the guru in you.**


    ***Not Your Guru Retreats*** provides the tristate area with the opportunity

    to escape the chaos of city living and a return to the serenity of nature

    and our circadian rhythms. 

     Our retreats are held in the picturesque **Hudson Valley,** less than 3 hours away from the city, and are led by **NYC's top fitness and wellness instructors.** 

    There are many reasons to **give yourself the gift of a Not Your Guru Retreat**.


    **These are our top 3!**

      description: "**Not Your Guru Retreats offers education for life**. Every
        individual is unique in their own journey, so the most powerful thing
        one can achieve is a deeper understanding and connection to self.  **We
        are not your guru; and no one should be**. This is why we offer a range
        of modalities and courses taught by experts across such practices as
        **yoga, pilates, nutrition, meditation, and functional training,** so
        you can discover what resonates best with your body and lifestyle."

      text: Expand Your Capabilities
      description: "**Experience yourself at your best and be extraordinary.**
        Expanding your capabilities is crucial for personal growth because it
        pushes you beyond your comfort zone. By taking on our challenges, you
        not only expand your skills and knowledge but also **build resilience
        and confidence in your abilities**. Not Your Guru Retreats fosters an
        environment where you can gauge your current strengths, identify areas
        for improvement, and set realistic goals - fitness or otherwise -
        tailored to your individual abilities."

      text: Connection to Self, Others, and Nature
      description: Remove yourself from the hustle and bustle of every day life, where
        **many of us spend our days looking right through other people**, and
        take time to **connect to yourself, others, and nature.** Connection and
        presence is essential for cultivating inner peace, fostering meaningful
        relationships, and experiencing the profound beauty of the natural
        world. Encountering other like-minded individuals in a serene retreat
        setting not only encourages camaraderie but also provides opportunities
        for shared growth, support, and inspiration.

  heading: About Me
  description: >-
    I grew up using physicality and exercise as a way to manage my early
    childhood trauma. My entire life is a journey of personal healing after a
    tragedy that rocked my family when I was young. 


    I got professionally involved in the world of fitness and development coaching at the age of 23 in 2010.


    It wasn’t until I learned how connected my emotional body and physical body are, and what it means to nourish these two bodies, that I learned to thrive in my circumstances.
