intro:
  heading: What Is Not Your Guru?
  description: "\"Not Your Guru\" is more than a brand; it's a philosophy rooted
    in the belief that true wellness comes from empowering individuals to
    cultivate a deeper connection with themselves. As a personal trainer and
    wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of services, including
    in-person training, online coaching, transformative retreats, and ready-made
    training programs. My approach is not about providing quick fixes or being
    someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping individuals with the tools they
    need to navigate their own journey towards physical and emotional
    well-being. With a lifetime of learning and personal experience in both
    realms, I aim to foster a supportive environment where clients can discover
    their inner strength, resilience, and self-awareness."

  description: Join us this summer for our Mind, Body, Soul Reset Series!  Our
    campus resides less than 3 hours outside of NYC in the Hudson Valley area
    and perfectly blends a luxurious air bnb getaway with a rustic environment
    in the beautiful nature of upstate New York.  This glamping experience
    blends the body with the spirit as we discover the physical effects of our
    emotional blocks and work through them with exercise, nature, and
    meditation.
