    Maybe something short to get people's attention
description: "\"Not Your Guru\" is more than a brand; it's a philosophy rooted
  in the belief that true wellness comes from empowering individuals to
  cultivate a deeper connection with themselves. As a personal trainer and
  wellness coach practitioner, I offer a diverse range of services, including
  in-person training, online coaching, transformative retreats, and ready-made
  training programs. My approach is not about providing quick fixes or being
  someone's guru; rather, it's about equipping individuals with the tools they
  need to navigate their own journey towards physical and emotional well-being.
  With a lifetime of learning and personal experience in both realms, I aim to
  foster a supportive environment where clients can discover their inner
  strength, resilience, and self-awareness."

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
